                            Impedance Spectroscopy Simulator  – ISS

The ISS software was developed to help students and researchers on the fundamentals of electrical Impedance Spectroscopy technique.

It allows to simulate the impedance spectra and Cole-Cole curves for several circuit models. It also allows fitting circuit models over experimental IS data.

ISS software was developed in LabVIEW and is provided for free as an executable software.
Just donwload and unzip the file "Impedance-Spectroscopy-Simulator-v9c.zip".
Before use this software you need to install the LabVIEW Runtime engine, version 2023 Q3, also for free, directly from the National Instruments website.
